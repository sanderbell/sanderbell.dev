        Hello, I'm Sander. In my previous career, I was a media specialist and
        manager, responsible for leading editorial teams, overseeing
        communications, and ensuring a positive reader's experience at major IT
        companies. I also worked in independent socio-political and technology
        journalism.

        Some time ago, I unexpectedly fell in love with programming and, to my
        surprise, realized that I had a knack for it. I discovered that web
        development is what I want to pursue in my life moving forward. I would
        be delighted if my skills and knowledge could help you bring your ideas
        and projects to fruition.
